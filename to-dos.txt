Backend (FastAPI)
Let's create a new FastAPI service that will:
    Handle question retrieval with filtering and pagination
    Track user progress
    Integrate with the existing Turso database
    Provide authentication middleware using Firebase tokens
Frontend Updates
The current QuestionView.tsx needs:
    API integration with the new FastAPI backend
    Loading states and error handling
    Image display support (currently missing)
    Progress tracking integration
    Subject filtering
Database Schema Updates
We need to add:
    User progress tracking
    Correct answers and explanations
    Image handling
    Performance metrics
    Authentication Flow
We already have Firebase auth implemented, but we need to:
    Pass auth tokens to FastAPI
    Handle session management
    Implement role-based access if needed
